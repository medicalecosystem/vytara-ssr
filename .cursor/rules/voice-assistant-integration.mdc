# Voice Assistant integration files

When you **add, remove, or rename** any file that is part of the Voice Assistant / chat integration (FAQ, language, LLM, or ChatWidget), you must:

1. **Update `VOICE_ASSISTANT_INTEGRATION_FILES.md`** in the project root:
   - Add or remove the file from the appropriate section (Copied / Related) and from the checklist.
   - Add a line to the **Changelog** table with the date and a short description of the change.

The list in that file is the single source of truth for "what to push to main" for this integration. Keeping it in sync avoids missing files when pushing.
